## Reanalysis


### ECMWF Reanalysis Version 5 (ERA5) - [CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview)

> This is a reanalysis dataset which are climate models which have assimilated observations.


#### Domain

Atmosphere: `dx = 0.25 x 0.25`

Ocean: `dx = 0.5 x 0.5`

#### Variables

A Lot...



### GLORYS

> A reanalysis dataset for the **ocean**. It is based on the NEMO model and observations.

### HYCOM

> A reanalysis dataset for the **ocean**. It is based on the ... model and observations.



## Simulations

### [**CMIP5**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/projections-cmip5-daily-single-levels?tab=overview)



### [**CMIP6**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/projections-cmip6?tab=overview)

> Some climate projections for the **land**, **atmosphere**, and **ocean**.


#### Period

> In general, we have 2 distinct periods: the *historical* period and the *ssp* period. 

**Historical Period**: 1850 - 2014

**Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)**: 2015 - 2100


#### Conditions

> There are a range of conditions available depending upon the scenario. 

| Scenario Acronym | Label |
