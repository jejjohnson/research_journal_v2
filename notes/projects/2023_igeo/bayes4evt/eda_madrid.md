## Data 

For this first experiment, we are looking at Madrid

A histogram of daily maximum 2m temperature in Madrid.

In this figure, we are showing different representations for the time series of Madrid.
In [](madrid-t2m-ts), there is a daily time series for the 2m max temperature.
In [](madrid-t2m-hist), there is a histogram for all of the values.
Of course, the distribution does not look like any of the traditional distributions from the GEVD ([](fig:gevd-disttypes)).
Unless we decide to condition on the seasonal cycle and/or other covariates, then we need to use some extreme value parser, e.g., block maximum or peak over threshold.


***
## Block Maxima

In these examples, we are applying the Block Maxima (BM) method on a yearly basis.
So, our block size is of one year which leaves us 62 years in total for our time series.
While this is not a lot of data, we see in [](fig:madrid-t2m-bm-hist) that the distribution does match one of the classical GEVD distributions. 
In particular, the Fr√©chet distribution where the shape parameter, $\kappa$, is less than 0 ([](fig:gevd-disttypes)).

::::

In this figure, we have different representations for the block maximum method.
We already see a trend line and perhaps a hint of cyclic behaviour.
In our first experiments, we see will assume a unconditional distribution however we can see that this assumption is incorrect as we can clearly see from [](fig:madrid-t2m-bm-scatter).
