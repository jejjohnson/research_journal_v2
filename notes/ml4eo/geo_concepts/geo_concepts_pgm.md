### Components

**Quantity of Interest**, $u$.
What do we want to predict?


**Measurements**, $y$.
What can we measure?
**Latent Variable**, $z$.
What we cannot measure but we need?

**Parameters**, $\theta$.
What unknown artifacts result from the parameterizations?

**Covariates**, $x$.
What are some measurable parameterizations that are outside of my system.
