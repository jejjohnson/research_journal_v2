# A Comprehensive Guide to Methane Monitoring Satellites

At its core, the observation of Earth from space is an exercise in discerning a whisper in a storm. The fundamental challenge we face, overarching every technological and scientific endeavor, is the optimization of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The "signal" is the specific, often faint, signature of the phenomenon we wish to measure—in this case, the subtle absorption of specific infrared wavelengths by methane molecules in a column of air. The "noise," however, is not merely the electronic hiss of an instrument; it is the chaotic, confounding, and overwhelming variability of the Earth system itself. It is the geophysical noise of a sunlit planet: the shifting albedo of forests and deserts, the spectral interference of water vapor, and the scattering of light by a dynamic atmosphere laden with aerosols and clouds.

Underpinning this is an even more fundamental truth: the phenomena we seek to measure are inherently multi-scale. Methane emissions do not occur at a single, convenient resolution. They exist across a continuum, from the slow, persistent seepage across a vast agricultural basin (large spatial scale, long temporal scale) to a brief, violent blowout from a single wellhead (small spatial scale, short temporal scale). Yet, due to the physical constraints of optics, energy, and orbital mechanics, any single sensor is fundamentally single-scale. A satellite cannot simultaneously have a microscope's precision and a panoramic camera's field of view. This inescapable trade-off means our measurement tools are also multi-scale by design. It is therefore a physical necessity that to measure a multi-scale world, we must deploy a multi-scale system of observation.

This SNR problem is fundamentally multi-dimensional and cannot be solved by optimizing a single variable. A satellite with perfect spatial vision is useless if its spectral hearing is deaf to methane's unique signature. An instrument with perfect spectral hearing is defeated if it only listens when the transient methane plume is absent. Therefore, the necessity for a multi-modal, "system of systems" approach is not a matter of convenience but a direct consequence of this physical reality. The practical implication of this SNR struggle is the instrument's detection limit—the minimum emission rate or concentration enhancement that can be confidently distinguished from the background noise. To truly isolate the methane signal and lower this detection limit, we must attack the noise from every possible dimension. The following report deconstructs this challenge, classifying the world's satellite assets across the three critical axes that define this problem: the spatial, the spectral, and the temporal.

## Tier 1: Spatial Resolution (The "Where")

ELI5: Imagine looking at a satellite photo of a city to find a burst water pipe. Spatial resolution is how much detail you can see. A low-resolution photo might show you a whole neighborhood is wet, but you can't tell if the water is coming from one massive burst water main or from fifty different garden sprinklers left on all day. You just see a big, blurry wet spot. A high-resolution photo, on the other hand, lets you zoom in to the street level. You can see the individual houses, and you can pinpoint the exact front yard where water is gushing from a single point. This is the difference between knowing there's a problem somewhere in the neighborhood and being able to send a plumber to the exact right address to fix it.

Technical Perspective: Spatial resolution, quantified by the Ground Sample Distance (GSD), dictates the smallest discernible element on the surface. However, the true resolving power is better described by the system's Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), which characterizes how well the sensor preserves the contrast of features at different spatial frequencies. For methane plumes, which are often smaller than a pixel, the signal gets averaged with the background radiance (sub-pixel mixing). This dilution effect directly reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, making high resolution critical for detecting and attributing point-source emissions. This is because retrieval algorithms attempt to solve for the concentration enhancement (ΔXCH4), and when the signal is averaged over a large area, the true enhancement at the source is severely underestimated, often falling below the algorithm's noise floor. Consequently, lower spatial resolution raises an instrument's detection limit, meaning only larger or more concentrated plumes are visible.

### A Multi-Tiered Application for Methane (Spatial):

- Low Resolution (Global & Regional Scan): The first step is to find the "wet neighborhood." These instruments trade fine detail for immense coverage, allowing them to monitor entire continents and oceans for large-scale methane anomalies. Their high detection limit means they can only see very large events.

- TROPOMI (Sentinel-5P): GSD of ~5.5 x 3.5 km. The workhorse for daily global mapping.
- GOSAT-2: Footprint of ~10 km diameter. A scientific instrument providing sparse but precise reference points.
- Geostationary Satellites (GOES, Himawari, Meteosat): GSD of ~1-2 km in their SWIR bands.

- Medium Resolution (Basin & Area Survey): Once a region of interest is found, this tier helps identify which specific industrial basin or large area is responsible.

- MethaneSAT: Target GSD of ~100 x 400 m. Fills a key niche, designed to survey wide areas like entire oil fields with enough detail to resolve major sources without needing to be tasked pixel by pixel.

- High Resolution (Source Attribution & Identification): This is the final "zoom-in" to find the burst pipe. These satellites have the sharp vision needed to pinpoint a leak to a specific facility or even a piece of equipment, providing actionable data for mitigation. Their fine GSD provides the lowest possible detection limit for point sources.

- GHGSat: GSD of ~25 x 25 m. A surgical tool for source attribution.
- Carbon Mapper: Target GSD of ~30 m. Also designed for precision source identification.
- PRISMA & EnMAP: GSD of 30 m. Hyperspectral imagers that provide detailed views when targeted.
- EMIT: GSD of ~60 x 60 m. While primarily for mineral dust, its resolution can help identify significant methane point sources.
- Sentinel-2 (MSI): GSD of 20 m.
- Landsat 8/9 (OLI): GSD of 30 m. Both are invaluable for using their vast, free archives to narrow down search areas for plume detection teams.

## Tier 2: Spectral Resolution (The "What")

ELI5: Imagine listening to an orchestra to hear only the violin, and your job is to make sure it's in tune. Spectral resolution is how good your hearing is. A person with low spectral resolution is "tone-deaf"—they just hear a loud mess of sound from the orchestra and can't even tell if a violin is playing. A person with good spectral resolution can easily pick out the violin's sound from all the other instruments. But a person with very high spectral resolution is like a professional conductor—they can not only hear the violin, but they can also tell what the stage floor is made of by the way the sound reflects off of it. They can hear the violin's primary note, but also all the subtle overtones that make its sound unique. This allows them to filter out the room's echo to hear the instrument's true sound with incredible clarity.

Technical Perspective: Spectral resolution, defined by the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of its channels, is critical for resolving the fine rotational-vibrational absorption lines in methane's spectral fingerprint in the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) region. High resolution allows algorithms like spectral matched filtering or differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) to apply the Beer-Lambert Law with high fidelity. This is essential to de-convolve the methane signal from interfering absorbers (like water vapor and carbon dioxide, which have nearby absorption features) and from surface albedo effects that can mimic absorption signals. A high-resolution spectrometer can resolve the distinct P, Q, and R branches of the methane absorption feature around 2.3μm, which is the unambiguous signature required for confident detection. Better spectral filtering more effectively removes noise, thereby lowering the detection limit and allowing weaker signals to be identified.

### A Multi-Tiered Application for Methane (Spectral):

- Low Resolution (Broadband Anomaly Detection): These sensors can hear a "loud noise" from the orchestra but can't be sure it's a violin. They can detect a dimming of infrared light that might be methane but are prone to false positives. Their poor spectral filtering results in a very high (poor) detection limit for methane.

- Sentinel-2 & Landsat 8/9: Both have very wide SWIR bands with a bandwidth of 180 nm.
- Geostationary Satellites (GOES, etc.): Possess only a few very broad SWIR channels, making them unsuitable for reliable methane confirmation.

- High Resolution (Methane Confirmation & Quantification): These are the true methane detectives. Their finely-tuned sensors can isolate the unique spectral fingerprint of methane, confirming its presence and measuring its concentration with confidence.

- TROPOMI: With a sharp spectral resolution of ~0.25 nm, it provides the world's daily, reliable map of methane concentrations.
- GOSAT-2: A scientific-grade spectrometer with an extremely high resolution of 0.2 cm⁻¹, used to provide sparse but highly accurate benchmark measurements.

- Very High Resolution (Precision Measurement & Surface Characterization): This is the "gold standard." These hyperspectral imagers not only identify methane with extreme precision but also use hundreds of other channels to identify the surface material below the plume. This removes background noise, leading to the lowest possible detection limit for a given observation.

- GHGSat & MethaneSAT: Both are purpose-built imaging spectrometers designed to resolve methane's absorption features with high fidelity.
- Carbon Mapper: Target spectral sampling of ~5-6 nm.
- EMIT: Spectral sampling of 7.4 nm.
- EnMAP: Spectral sampling of 10 nm.
- PRISMA: Spectral sampling of <12 nm.

## Tier 3: Temporal Cadence (The "When")

ELI5: Imagine you want to photograph a firefly that only flashes for a second at night, but you also want to understand its secret blinking code. Temporal cadence is how often you take a picture. If you take one picture every hour (low cadence), you will almost certainly miss the flash entirely. If you take one picture every minute, you might catch a single flash, proving the firefly was there, but you won't know the pattern. But if you take a continuous video (very high cadence), you can see every single flash and pause. This allows you to not just detect the firefly but to understand its behavior—is it flashing randomly, or is it sending a specific message? For industrial emissions, this is the difference between knowing a facility leaks sometimes and knowing it leaks every Tuesday at 2 PM for exactly 15 minutes.

Technical Perspective: Temporal cadence (revisit time, Δt) is the sampling frequency of an emission source. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, to accurately characterize a signal, one must sample at a frequency at least twice that of the signal's highest frequency component. Intermittent emissions are common, and if their duration or frequency is shorter than the satellite's Δt (i.e., the sampling is sub-Nyquist), the signal becomes aliased. This can cause a brief, high-frequency leak to be misinterpreted as a constant, low-level emission, or be missed entirely, leading to significant underestimation in emission inventories. A low temporal cadence means the system's effective detection limit for intermittent sources is very poor, as countless events will fall below the temporal sampling threshold and be missed entirely.

### A Multi-Tiered Application for Methane (Temporal):

- Very High Cadence (Near-Real-Time Tracking): These satellites stare at one part of the Earth constantly, making them perfect for creating a near-live movie of a massive, unfolding event, like a major gas well blowout.

- Geostationary Satellites (GOES, Himawari, Meteosat): Scans every 5-15 minutes.

- High Cadence (Systematic Monitoring): The key to discovery is to look everywhere, often. These instruments provide the daily or near-daily coverage needed to spot new or intermittent plumes and establish a global baseline.

- TROPOMI: Global revisit of once every 24 hours.
- EMIT (on ISS): The space station's unique orbit allows it to revisit major land areas every few days.

- Medium Cadence (Routine Check-ups): These workhorses provide regular, reliable imagery for a wide range of applications, including methane. Their consistent revisit schedule is good for checking on known areas of concern.

- Sentinel-2 (Constellation): Revisit of ~5 days at the equator.
- Landsat 8/9 (Constellation): Revisit of 8 days.

- Low Cadence (On-Demand Investigation): These are the specialists, called in for a targeted look. They don't scan broadly but are tasked to investigate specific sites identified by the higher-cadence systems.

- GHGSat, Carbon Mapper, MethaneSAT, PRISMA, EnMAP: As taskable, high-resolution systems, their revisit time for any specific, non-prioritized location can be days to weeks, depending on priority.
- GOSAT-2: Has a 3-day repeat cycle, but its sparse sampling means it's not designed for comprehensive monitoring of specific sites.

## Conclusion: A Three-Dimensional Solution to the Signal-to-Noise Problem

As we established in the beginning, the ultimate pursuit in observing our planet is the maximization of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Having now classified the tools at our disposal, we can see clearly how this challenge must be confronted in three dimensions, with each class of satellite contributing a crucial piece to solving the puzzle.

- The Spatial Dimension of SNR: The signal from a methane plume is spatially concentrated. A high-resolution satellite like GHGSat (~25m GSD) maximizes SNR by using a small pixel that isolates this concentrated signal from the surrounding, non-emitting background. Conversely, a TROPOMI pixel (~5.5km GSD) viewing the same plume sees that signal severely diluted by a vast area of clean air, effectively burying the signal in spatial noise and lowering the SNR. High spatial resolution is our tool for combating signal dilution.
- The Spectral Dimension of SNR: The methane signal is spectrally unique. A hyperspectral imager like Carbon Mapper (~6nm sampling) acts as a precision filter, isolating the exact fingerprint of methane from the spectral noise of water vapor and variable surface materials. A broadband sensor like Sentinel-2 (180nm bandwidth) is, by contrast, spectrally nearsighted; its wide channel captures the methane signal but lumps it in with all the adjacent noise, making confident detection impossible. High spectral resolution is our tool for filtering out confounding signatures.
- The Temporal Dimension of SNR: The signal from many plumes is transient. The SNR of a measurement is effectively zero if the satellite observes when the signal itself is not present. A low-cadence, taskable satellite like PRISMA may visit a site only to find no emissions, missing the story entirely. A high-cadence sensor like TROPOMI (24-hour revisit) fundamentally increases the probability of capturing the signal's existence, ensuring that there is a signal to measure against the noise in the first place. High temporal cadence is our tool for ensuring the signal is even there to be found.

No single satellite can conquer all three dimensions of this problem simultaneously. The necessity of a "system of systems" is therefore not merely a strategy but the fundamental solution. We use the high temporal and spectral fidelity of TROPOMI to find the signal, then deploy the high spatial and spectral fidelity of GHGSat or Carbon Mapper to isolate and confirm it. Together, they form a virtual instrument, orchestrating a multi-dimensional assault on noise to reveal the clear, actionable whisper of methane in the storm. This multi-scale approach is the best we can do. It is the pragmatic and elegant answer to the profound challenge of using our constrained, single-scale instruments to observe a world of infinite, multi-scale complexity. We must, however, always remember the fundamental reality of the detection limit. Even with this sophisticated approach, every measurement is bounded by what it can practically see, reminding us that there will always be emissions too small or too brief for our systems to capture, an uncertainty that must be acknowledged in our global accounting.
