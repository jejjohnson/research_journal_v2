**Statistical Model**.



**Uncertainty Quantification**. The quantification of the effect of various sources of error (from model, simulation, experiment) on a predicted quantity of interest.

**Model Verification**. The process of quantifying the accuracy of simulation codes used to implement mathematical models (i.e., are we solving the equations correctly?)

**Model Validation**. The process of determining the accuracy which mathematical models represent the physical processes of interest (i.e, are we solving the correct equations?)

**Sensitivity Analysis**. How uncertainty in the output of a model can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the model input.
